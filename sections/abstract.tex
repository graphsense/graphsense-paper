% What is the motivation / background for this paper?
There is currently an increasing demand for cryptoasset analysis tools among cryptoasset service providers, the financial industry in general, as well as across academic fields.
% Why is it important / what hasn't been done so far?
At the moment, one can choose between commercial services or low-level open-source tools providing programmatic access.
% What is your contribution / key findings?
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of another option: the GraphSense Cryptoasset Analytics Platform, which can be used for interactive investigations of monetary flows and, more importantly, for executing advanced analytics tasks using a standard data science tool stack.
% What is the impact of your findings?
By providing a growing set of open-source components, GraphSense could ultimately become an instrument for scientific investigations in academia and a possible response to emerging compliance and regulation challenges for businesses and organizations dealing with cryptoassets.
