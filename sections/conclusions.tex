\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% Summary
GraphSense is a response to the increasing need for a general-purpose cryptoasset analytics platform. In this paper, we discussed the network abstractions relevant in this field, elaborated on our design rationale, and described the architecture and current technical building blocks of GraphSense.
% Future work
We will certainly continue developing GraphSense as part of our research activities in the field of cryptoasset analytics and expect that GraphSense will soon support analytics across UTXO and account-model ledgers and, if relevant, also off-chain payment channels. We also expect and see to some extent that future GraphSense development will become more a community effort, which is driven by academia and stakeholders in the financial industry and the emerging CryptoFinance field.
